# 1h-POC - Getting familiar with AWS IoT Greengrass using Docker.

## AWS IoT Greengrass with Docker

AWS IoT Greengrass provides cloud capabilities to a local environment. It is qualified as a containerized AWS Lambda runtime environment with prebuilt connectos for serverless apllications. Edge computing requirements can be supported as far as local resources can be made accessible for these local devices. 

## Objective

Run IoT Greengrass in a Docker Container, evaluate possible interfaces to/from external resources.

## Some Sample

Define a device and some pre-processing on it's data for publishing to an external MQTT Broker.

## Result

Seems to be possible in a non-experimental resp. acceptable manner.
