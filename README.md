# One hour PoC - Getting familiar with AWS IoT Greengrass using Docker.

## AWS IoT Greengrass with Docker

AWS IoT Greengrass provides cloud capabilities to a local environment. It may be qualified as a AWS Lambda runtime environment with prebuilt connectos for serverless apllications. Edge computing requirement can be supported as far as local resources can be made accessible for theso local devices. This enables devices to collect and analyze data closer to the source of information, react autonomously to local events, and communicate securely with each other on local networks. AWS IoT Greengrass developers can use AWS Lambda functions and prebuilt connectors to create serverless applications that are deployed to devices for local execution.


## Objective

Run IoT Greengrass in a Docker Container, evaluate possible interfaces to/from external resources.

## Result

Seems to be possible in a non-experimental resp. acceptable manner.
